# BomberKof
This is a game made for the Programming Introduction Course (IF669). It was inspired in the famous game "BomberMan", but the characters are penguins instead. To execute you'll need to have both C language support and the Allegro library installed. Run the makefile in the terminal if the conditions above are met.
